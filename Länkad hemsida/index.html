Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science-fiction sitcom created by 
<br> 
Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's nighttime programming block Adult Swim. 
<br> 
It is distributed internationally by Warner Bros. Television Distribution. 
<br> 
The series follows the misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and 
<br> 
his good-hearted but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and 
<br> 
interdimensional adventures that take place across an infinite number of realities, 
<br> 
often travelling to other planets and dimensions through portals and on Rick's flying saucer.
