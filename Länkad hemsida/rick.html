<body><h1>Rick</h1> 
    <br>
    Richard "Rick" Sanchez of Dimension C-137, commonly referred to as Rick C-137,
    <br> is the titular main protagonist of the Rick and Morty franchise.
    <br>
    He is a megagenius[5] scientist whose alcoholism and reckless,
    <br> nihilistic behavior are sources of concern for his "daughter's" family, 
    <br> as well as the safety of their son, Morty. Upon the series' inception,
    <br> Rick's mysterious origins and mental health were large sources of speculation. 
    <br> As time has gone on, more has been revealed about his character; 
    <br> his backstory explaining much of his behavior. 
    <br> At the same time, Rick has continuously committed more heinous acts[6][7], 
    <br> certifying him as the series' anti-hero, bordering on antagonist.
