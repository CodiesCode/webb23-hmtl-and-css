<body><h1>Morty</h1> 
    <br>
    Mortimer Chauncey "Morty" Smith Sr. of the Prime Universe/Cronenberged Dimension 
    <br> 
    is the titular deuteragonist of Rick and Morty. He is also one of the five main characters of Rick and Morty. 
    <br>

    He is the grandson of Rick Sanchez and is often forced to tag along on his various misadventures. 
    <br> 
    Morty attends Harry Herpson High School along with his sister, Summer.[8] 
    <br> 
    At the beginning of the series, Morty was shown to be an incredibly anxious and submissive teenage boy. 
    <br> 
    However, after going on many so-called adventures with Rick, Morty has seemingly become more confident 
    <br> 
    and his own person[9], independent from Rick, rather than a mere sidekick.
